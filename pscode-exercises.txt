// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)ask user to input one number and enter into a varible "A"
 ask user to input the next number and enter into variable "B" 
print sum  A + B = C

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here) C%2==0 if true its even if false its odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
User imput for 5 numbers   input 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5
  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
input 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = sum /5 = Average

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Array with the 5 (integers)numbers assign it to a variable
need a function to find minimum integer
need a function to find maximum integer
print each to screen


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Print Average "Message this is the Average"
Print minimum "Message this is the smallest number"
Print maximum "Message this is the largest number"
